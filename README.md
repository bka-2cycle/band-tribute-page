# Band Tribute Page

## Description

The goal was to create a web page dedicated to one of my favorite bands. I created the page to share my thoughts about the band and provide interesting and useful information regarding the members and their music. It informs the user about the band and provides links to more in depth information. Completing the project I learned about the relationship between 3 primary coding languages and how to implement features and display content in a well-designed manner.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Along with general information about the band, there is a slide show of all the bands studio albums grouped in four, with indication of the year it was released. There is also an image link to a YouTube video of my favorite song by the band, in addition to a text link the bands official website.
