    <h1>A Rock Band Like No Other</h1>
    <p>I think I was in 5th grade when I heard my first Rush song. I was instantly hooked. By then the band already had a half dozen studio albums in their portfolio. Which gave me plenty of music to explore, going back to their debut album and moving forward, it was interesting to hear the music as they matured as musicians from one album to the next. The one thing that has always intrigued me about this band is their song lyrics, moved from sci-fi to the trials of adolescence, but never digging into love or relationships, and this was unique because that was the norm in popular Rock song writing.<br><br>
    The band was it was comprised of three members. Geddy Lee, the lead singer, bass player and keyboardist, Niel Peart who played drums and wrote the majority of the bands song lyrics and Alex Lifeson on guitar. When you listen to a Rush song you notice things that you normally would not notice with rock songs of the era. Most songs move you as a whole, one melodic vessel taking you on a journey, you dont hear the parts moving, just the engine running. Rush songs have a way of making you notice the moving parts, as each band member contributes uniquely to the running engine. The melodic journey is the same as any other great song, but the individual instruments beg your attention, so mush so that you eagerly anticipate drum, bass and guitar parts throughout. Each instrument taking the spotlight in a coordinated ballet of melody and rythem. To put it more sisinctly, the music just moves your senses, like no other band.</p>
